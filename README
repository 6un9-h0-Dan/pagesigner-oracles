This repo contains instructions and files needed to set up an oracle server running as an AWS instance.
This oracle server serves as a notary for PageSigner. It can be adopted to the needs of any other project which requires a trusted computing setup.
The oracle server is set up in such a manner that even the owner who launched it is unable to log into it or see its internal state.

See INSTALL.oracles for more in-depth instructions.
